This is an NP-HARD problem solved using Genetic Algorithm


The problem is to find a minimum number of guards to monitor all the art placed in a polygon shaped space. This is classified as NP-HARD and we are here to develop a solution which is nearly perfect. This can be applied for a complex orthogonal convex polygon or a regular convex polygon.

Input : A convex polygon randomly generated 
Output : No of guards and locations to be placed to ensure all the areas of a given ploygon are covered

There are several variations of this problem. Here we are focusing on a solution where the guards can be placed only on the vertices of the polygon.
